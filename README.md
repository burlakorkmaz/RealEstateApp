# Real Estate Application - Windows Form Application

## ABOUT
In 2015 I developed this project without connecting to the database and i used object-oriented programming techniques.After I learned connecting to a database(MS SQL Server) and learned how to use it(in 2018),I have redeveloped my project by connecting it to the database.

### To Use Data Base Server
